Comprehensive Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Core Architecture Refactoring (Current Priority)
Modular Dungeon Generation


May have to work up to the next part because I simplified things to get them to the point the DeepSeek could help me fix them.
[x] Now I have movement of party and blocking by walls kind of working
[x] Still need to fix initial party placement so it doesn't just moev to the right. It should move to the open corridor spot next to the stairs.
[x] Need to fix orientation of some doors
[x] Get Fog Of War implemented, right now its all clear so the dungeon shows through.
[x] Still need to fix it so it uses line of sight blocking.
[x] Need to fix rendering of secret door in masked mode. shows as corridor I think but should show as wall.
[x] DM can now change doors with create_door tool allowing movement through arch
[] Maybe add more manipulation of dungeon for DM to draw random things but maybe that is just a wish or I can generate a bunch for him to use. But don't let details bog you down so maybe for later.
[] Might be nice to add open door and switch door from regular look to open door. Locked would change to regular door. Opened door would swing inward or outward maybe randomize? Portcullis becomes arch when open. Again maybe these are enhancements when I get farther along. Love to get this buttoned up a little so we can add AI back.
[] Take a look at AI DM apis.txt located top left portion of desktop with suggestions from AI about integrating some DM tools to keep it simple.
** Note Walls are not a cell thing, they are a construct in my mind and they are drawn.. may be an issue to deal with later. It surprised me. We block on NOTHING for now.

Split DungeonGenerator into:

[x]LayoutGenerator (room/corridor algorithms) - leaving this as is becauase its fairly fragile to mess with

[]FeaturePlacer (puzzles/traps/monsters)

[]DungeonBuilder (orchestration facade) - not sure if this is worth doing as fragile as some of this is. lets call it a todo maybe some day

[]Preserve AI integration points (puzzle creation, content generation)

[x]State Management Unification - I think I accomplished this by my previous simplifications

[x]Complete UnifiedGameState integration - I think this is also accomplished by previous simplifications

(Removed interfaces making for a simpler design for now)
Phase 2: AI Integration Enhancement
Agent Refactoring

Break EnhancedDMAgent into:

[x]CommandParser (natural language processing) commands and tools workish, need to maybe fix some but happy so far

[x]ActionExecutor (tool execution)

ContentGenerator (dynamic content creation)

[x]Tool Registry System

[x]Complete tool interface definitions

Implement versioning for AI tools

[]Add tool dependency management

Puzzle System Upgrade

Implement stateful puzzle progression

Add puzzle difficulty scaling

Integrate with world narrative threads

Phase 3: Multiplayer Foundation
State Serialization

Implement JSON schema for game state

Add versioned state snapshots

Develop delta compression for updates

Network Architecture

Design WebSocket protocol

Implement action queuing system

Add conflict resolution mechanisms

Session Management

Create lobby system

Implement player session persistence

Develop invite/join workflows

Phase 4: Content Pipeline
Procedural Generation API

Standardize content templates

Implement biome-specific generators

Add quest dependency graphs

Dynamic Narrative System

Create story fragment database

Implement narrative tension algorithm

Add player-driven plot hooks

Thematic Content Packs

Develop swapable theme system

Create asset manifest format

Implement hot-reloading

Phase 5: Optimization & Scaling
Performance Profiling

Dungeon generation benchmarks

Pathfinding optimization

Visibility system improvements

Implement CI/CD workflow

Create auto-scaling configuration

Key Principles for Development:
Atomic Commits - Each change isolated and testable

Test-Driven Progress:

graph LR
  A[Write Test] --> B[Make Change]
  B --> C[Run Tests]
  C --> D{Pass?}
  D -->|Yes| E[Commit]
  D -->|No| F[Debug]

Continuous Integration - Automated testing on every commit

Documentation Parallel - Update docs with each code change

Next Session Focus:
Finalize dungeon state unification

Complete renderer interface implementation

Resolve test generator integration

Begin multiplayer state serialization design

This roadmap maintains our core goals while grounding each step in practical implementation. We'll continue using git as our safety net, with each session focusing on completing one vertical slice of functionality end-to-end before moving to the next.

3. Suggested UI Layout
html
<div class="app-container">
  <!-- Existing Map & Chat Panels -->
  <div class="character-panel">
    <div class="tabs">
      <button class="tab active" data-target="players">Players</button>
      <button class="tab" data-target="npcs">NPCs</button>
      <button class="tab" data-target="monsters">Monsters</button>
    </div>
    
    <div id="players" class="tab-content active">
      <!-- Character sheet component -->
    </div>
    
    <div id="dice-tray">
      <div class="dice-presets">
        <button data-roll="d20">d20</button>
        <button data-roll="2d6">2d6</button>
        <input type="text" id="custom-roll" placeholder="1d4+2">
      </div>
      <div id="roll-results"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
4. Backend API Extensions
python
# dice.py
from dnd_character import dice

@api_bp.route('/roll', methods=['POST'])
def roll_dice():
    formula = request.json.get('formula', 'd20')
    result = dice.roll(formula)
    return jsonify({
        "formula": formula,
        "result": result.total,
        "breakdown": result.breakdown
    })

# character.py
from dnd_character import Character

@api_bp.route('/character/create', methods=['POST'])
def create_character():
    char = Character()
    return jsonify(char.sheet())

@api_bp.route('/character/<id>/roll-skill', methods=['POST'])
def roll_skill(id):
    skill = request.json.get('skill')
    modifier = characters[id].skills[skill]
    roll = dice.roll(f"d20+{modifier}")
    return jsonify({
        "skill": skill,
        "result": roll.total,
        "details": roll.breakdown
    })
5. AI Integration Enhancements
python
# Updated system prompt addition
SYSTEM_PROMPT += """
## Dice and Character Rules:
- Use roll_dice tool for any random determination
- Reference character stats with get_character_details
- Combat actions: attack <target>, cast <spell>, use <item>

## Available RPG Tools:
1. roll_dice: formula (e.g., "d20+5")
2. get_character: character_id 
3. character_skill_check: character_id, skill_name
4. npc_action: npc_id, action_type
"""

# Sample tool
@tool(name="roll_dice", description="Roll dice using D&D notation")
def roll_dice(formula: str):
    return {"result": dice.roll(formula).total}
6. Character Storage Structure
python
{
  "id": "char_abc123",
  "type": "pc/npc/monster",
  "name": "Gimli",
  "stats": {
    "str": 16, "dex": 10, "con": 14,
    "int": 8, "wis": 12, "cha": 10
  },
  "skills": {"athletics": 5, "perception": 3},
  "inventory": ["axe", "chainmail"],
  "hp": {"current": 32, "max": 32},
  "ac": 16,
  "position": [15, 22]  # Map position
}
7. Combat Workflow Integration
Initiative Tracking:

Auto-roll initiative when combat starts

Sortable turn order panel

Attack Resolution:

python
@api_bp.route('/combat/attack', methods=['POST'])
def resolve_attack():
    attacker = request.json['attacker_id']
    target = request.json['target_id']
    
    # Roll attack
    attack_roll = dice.roll(f"d20+{characters[attacker].attack_bonus}")
    
    # Check hit
    if attack_roll.total >= characters[target].ac:
        damage = dice.roll(characters[attacker].damage)
    return jsonify({"hit": True, "damage": damage.total})
8. Suggested Feature Additions
Character Token Integration:

Drag character tokens onto map

Click tokens to open character sheets

Automated Combat Log:

plaintext
[System] Goblin attacks Player (16 vs AC 15): HIT! 5 damage
Condition Tracking:

Visual indicators for poisoned, blessed, etc.

Auto-apply condition effects to rolls

Spell Management:

Spell slot tracking

Area effect visualization

Loot Generator:

AI-generated treasure chests

Inventory management tools

9. Security Considerations
Validate all dice formulas with regex:

regex
^\d*d\d+(?:\s*[+-]\s*\d+)?$
Sanitize character names/content

Implement ownership checks for characters

This integration would transform your dungeon explorer into a full D&D virtual tabletop with persistent characters, rules-automated combat, and AI-enhanced gameplay. The implementation can be phased - start with dice rolling and character sheets before adding combat automation.
