Comprehensive Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Core Architecture Refactoring (Current Priority)
Modular Dungeon Generation

Split DungeonGenerator into:

LayoutGenerator (room/corridor algorithms)

FeaturePlacer (puzzles/traps/monsters)

DungeonBuilder (orchestration facade)

Preserve AI integration points (puzzle creation, content generation)

State Management Unification

Complete UnifiedGameState integration

Resolve circular dependencies with interfaces:

python
# src/interfaces.py
class IDungeonState(ABC):
    def get_visible_area(self): ...
    def move_party(self, direction): ...
    # Other essential methods
Rendering Abstraction

Finalize IRenderer interface

Implement adapter for EnhancedDungeonState

Complete WebRenderer for JSON output

Phase 2: AI Integration Enhancement
Agent Refactoring

Break EnhancedDMAgent into:

CommandParser (natural language processing)

ActionExecutor (tool execution)

ContentGenerator (dynamic content creation)

Tool Registry System

Complete tool interface definitions

Implement versioning for AI tools

Add tool dependency management

Puzzle System Upgrade

Implement stateful puzzle progression

Add puzzle difficulty scaling

Integrate with world narrative threads

Phase 3: Multiplayer Foundation
State Serialization

Implement JSON schema for game state

Add versioned state snapshots

Develop delta compression for updates

Network Architecture

Design WebSocket protocol

Implement action queuing system

Add conflict resolution mechanisms

Session Management

Create lobby system

Implement player session persistence

Develop invite/join workflows

Phase 4: Content Pipeline
Procedural Generation API

Standardize content templates

Implement biome-specific generators

Add quest dependency graphs

Dynamic Narrative System

Create story fragment database

Implement narrative tension algorithm

Add player-driven plot hooks

Thematic Content Packs

Develop swapable theme system

Create asset manifest format

Implement hot-reloading

Phase 5: Optimization & Scaling
Performance Profiling

Dungeon generation benchmarks

Pathfinding optimization

Visibility system improvements

Implement CI/CD workflow

Create auto-scaling configuration

Key Principles for Development:
Atomic Commits - Each change isolated and testable

Test-Driven Progress:

graph LR
  A[Write Test] --> B[Make Change]
  B --> C[Run Tests]
  C --> D{Pass?}
  D -->|Yes| E[Commit]
  D -->|No| F[Debug]

Continuous Integration - Automated testing on every commit

Documentation Parallel - Update docs with each code change

Next Session Focus:
Finalize dungeon state unification

Complete renderer interface implementation

Resolve test generator integration

Begin multiplayer state serialization design

This roadmap maintains our core goals while grounding each step in practical implementation. We'll continue using git as our safety net, with each session focusing on completing one vertical slice of functionality end-to-end before moving to the next.
